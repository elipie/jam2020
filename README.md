# PEACH - Prototypical language with knack for extensibility

In PEACH, all types are objects, and vice versa. Everything is an object, and that includes functions.

*** EDIT ME***
You can swap out methods on objects and patch them at runtime. Every operator calls a method which is easily overloadable, allowing heaps of extensibility. 
* talk about huge parts of language being written in itself
* write about how we are planning a rewrite in C/C++ and both have experience writing languages in each
